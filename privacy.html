&nbsp;<br>
5.13 <strong>Right to withdraw consent.</strong> To the extent that the legal basis we are relying on for processing your personal data is consent, you are entitled to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.&nbsp;<br>
